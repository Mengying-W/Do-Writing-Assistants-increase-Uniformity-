Do Writing Assistants Increase Uniformity? - NLP/Data Science

– Objective: Examined the impact of writing assistant tools on text, focusing on variations, content similarity, and
content diversity at different granularities (paragraph, sentence, and word levels)

– Content: Built up the dataset and preprocessed the text data. Analyzed the text using multiple contextual
language models(LMs) to generate embedding vectors. Compared the similarity between original and processed
text, explored the average similarity between vector-formed point clouds, and measured changes in Convex Hull
volume

– Conclusion: Writing assistant tools retain the original text structure and intended content while enhancing semantic
diversity. They provide valuable support in improving text quality without compromising its underlying structure
and message

– Tool Used: Python, TF-IDF, YAKE, KNN, PCA, Jaccard, Convex Hull, Tensorflow, PyTorch, BERT/GPT-2/ALBERT/senBERT/longformer/XL-Net
